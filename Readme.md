# Reporting for WinForms - Bind a Report to an Excel Workbook at Runtime

This example creates a new blank report at runtime and binds the report to data obtained from a Microsoft Excel (XLSX) file.

The [ExcelDataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.DataAccess.Excel.ExcelDataSource) class instance is used to retrieve data from an XLSX file. The data source schema is defined in code.
